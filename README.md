**Bad URL Killer:** Your Proactive Web Guardian
Bad URL Killer is a browser extension dedicated to providing a safer web Browse experience for everyone. It's especially valuable for users whose existing antivirus solutions may lack robust, real-time web reputation services to filter malicious websites.

**How Bad URL Killer Protects You:**

**Community-Powered Threat Intelligence:** We leverage a dynamic cloud-based community whitelist and blacklist, transparently hosted on public GitHub. This allows for rapid updates and collaborative threat identification.

**Advanced Dynamic Scanning:** When you visit a website, Bad URL Killer first checks these community-driven lists. If a site is unclassified, its URL is submitted to an advanced backend scanning engine for immediate, in-depth analysis.

**Instant Protection:** Should any scanning engine identify a website as malicious, Bad URL Killer will immediately block your access, preventing you from encountering phishing attempts, malware, and other online dangers.

New! Never land on a malicious site again! Get immediate visual security with a colored badge, and rely on our smart, Adaptive-block feature that stops the page from fully loading if it's confirmed dangerous during navigation.

With Bad URL Killer, you gain an essential layer of security, empowering you to surf the web with greater confidence.
